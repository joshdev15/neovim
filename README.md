# Neovim

My custom neovim settings

**WARNING!: This configuration is in the development/experimental phase,**

This configuration uses Lua as its main language.

The Lua programming language is supported by Neovim since version 0.5.0, so it
is recommended that you upgrade to a higher version than the one mentioned
above.

This configuration is mainly set up to work on Linux, take your precautions if
you will use it on a different OS.

It is also necessary to have the following programs installed and configured;

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Nodejs (preferably a recent version)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
- [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)

Remember to set your environment variables and binary locations correctly.

You can install any lsp server with :LspInstallInfo nvim command
